# Interpretable machine learning model for DNA aptamer design and analysis

This repository allows to reproduce the figures in [this paper](add_link_paper).

## Data:
The data used (described in the paper) has been uploade to Zenodo at [this link](add_link_data). For the notebooks to work, the 4 data files must be placed into a `data` folder, which must be created inside the main directory of this repository.

## Dependencies:
The code to make the figures is in several Jupyter notebooks, all written in python 3. The notebooks use standard scientific computing packages, that can be obtained for instance through the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
The code to instantiate, train and use Restricted Boltzmann Machines exploits the packages provided with [Jerome Tubiana's repository](https://github.com/jertubiana/PGM). The first cell of each notebook uses [`GitPython`](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython) to clone locally this repository.
